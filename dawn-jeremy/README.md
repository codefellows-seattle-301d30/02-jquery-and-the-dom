# KiloDonkeyBawling

**Author**: Dawn Aldrich and Jeremy Crawford
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview


We refactored forEach loops - we used jquery to clone a template of a blog post and populated the HTML with these clones. The code was already written to order these by date. 

## Getting Started


To build this app, you must first get the starter code from Allie. Then you need to pull in the jQuery CDN script for your browser - we used the Google CDN

## Architecture

Languages used: html, css, js, jquery
Design info - get images from Brook and his twitter.
