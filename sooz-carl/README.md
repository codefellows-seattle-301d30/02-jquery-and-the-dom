# Kilovolt Blog - Lab 02 

**Author**: Carl Olson and Suzanne Richman
**Version**: 1.0.5 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

We want to create content for users that shows most recent articles first and in an easy to read format for both mobile and desktop views. 


## Getting Started

The user would need to 
* Create index.html
* Get the icons from IcoMoon
* Get the normalize.css from github.com/necolas/normalize.css
* Search and find images of bacon, baseball, and cats
* Add filler text
* Build CSS files according to SMACSS methodology
* Include link to jQuery library (CDN)
* Create the articles as objects within an array with consistent property values
* Create a constructor function to make the article array accessible to the constructor's method
* Use jQuery to access and clone HTML elements of the DOM and populate those elements with content from the article array
* Create forEach loops to generate new object instances and then append them to the DOM

## Architecture

We used IcoMoon icon font for navigation icons. We included the jQuery library. We used Chrome to analyze and inspect. Project is built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
