A site to display blog articles in a clear, logical way so that a usesr can find the most recent articles first and the blog is easy to read. The code is DRY and renders articles from a separate data file so that my HTML file is not cluttered with lengthy and repetitive code. Utilizes the jQuery library's functionality so that it efficiently accesses, traverses, and manipulates elements on the DOM and optimize s iteration with JavaScript array methods so that the code is more condensed and maintainable.
