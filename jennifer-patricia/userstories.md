# User

As a user, I want an application that is easy to use, appeals visually, and easily provides the information I am looking for. I want a display that is similar on desktop and mobile so that my experience is familiar, but has been tailored to maximize ease of use for each viewing experience. I want to be able to view blog entries by publication date and have a clickable author name link to be able to learn more information about them.

# Developer
I want to use industry standards (such as SMACSS) to organize code and styling so that muy code is easy to edit and maintain. I want to have logical placement of code and challenge myself to learn. I want to optimize iteration with JavaScript array methods so that my code is more condensed and maintainable. I want a constructor function for my articles so that when a new blog entry is added, the javascript code does not have to change.
